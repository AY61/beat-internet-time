# beat-internet-time
A Python function that will return the Swatch Internet Time (or .beat time) as a string. For those who don't know .beat was a time format made by Swatch during the dot com bubble era. The idea was to unify the worlds time for the internet age by having a standard time system that is independant of timezones. The day would be divided into 1000 beats an be set based on the Zurich timezone. Time was expressed with an @ symbol follow by the beats as a 3 digit number with 2 decimal places. Each beat is 86.4 seconds long.

I saw this come up on a video by legendary Sonic lore god Cybershell when he was talking about rare Dreamcast consoles. Apparantly there was a tie in with Swatch and a few games actually used .beat internet time. Since I'm learning programming, I thought it would be a fun little challenge to make this. If it's actually usefull to someone then go ahead. Do what you will with the code but do consider telling me if you do something intresting with it as I am intrested to see if this is used in any way.
